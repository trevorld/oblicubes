Description: Three-dimensional rendering for 'grid' and 'ggplot2' graphics using cubes and cuboids drawn with an oblique projection.  As a special case also supports primary view orthographic projections.  Can be viewed as an extension to the 'isocubes' package <https://github.com/coolbutuseless/isocubes>.
