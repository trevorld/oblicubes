Description: Provides functions for 3D rendering in 'grid' and 'ggplot2' graphics via an oblique projection using cubes and cuboids.  Also supports 2D rendering via a primary view orthographic projection.  Can be viewed as an extension to the 'isocubes' package <https://github.com/coolbutuseless/isocubes>.
